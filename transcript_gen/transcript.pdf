[Music] hello students welcome to our channel learning notebook in today's video we will do complete chapter of place value for class 1. before starting with this chapter let me tell you we have made videos on every chapter of class 1 mathematics we also have interesting worksheets and quizzes on each chapter you can find all of them on our channel learning notebook also you can see a list of all such videos on our website the link to our website is below in the description box so let's see what all topics we are going to cover today in this video in this video we will do two digit numbers we will learn their place value their place value chart how to write expanded form and short form of a two digit number then we will do some questions and in the end i will give you a worksheet for your practice so let's start with two digit numbers students we know the greatest one digit number is 9 so now the question is what is 9 plus 1 it is 10 and 10 is a smallest 2 digit number now which is the greatest 2 digit number it is 9 9 this is the greatest two digit number ninety nine now let's learn places in a two digit number there are two places in a two digit number one's place which is denoted by o and tens place which is denoted by t so remember there are two places in a two digit number one's place and tens place now let's understand place value chart of a two digit number let's make a place value chart for the 2 digit number which is 34 so here students 4 is at which place yes it is at one's place so write 4 at once place in the place value chart now next digit is 3 which is at tens place so we will write 3 at tens place in the place value chart so this is the place value chart of number 34 now let's learn place value of each digit of a two digit number students this is the place value chart of number 34 now we have to tell what is the place value of 4 here and 3 here and how to tell place value let's see here 4 is at one's place so its place value is 4 once or just 4. now 3 is at tens place so its place value is 3 tens or just 30 let me tell you once again place value of 4 since it is at one's place so its place value is 4 once or 4 now 3 is at tens place so its place value is 3 10 or 30 so this is how we write the place value of each digit of a two digit number now let's do one more question make place value chart and guide place values of 6 7 so let's first make place value chart of this number here students seven is at one's place so like seven at one's place in the place value chart then six is at tens place so like six at tens place in the place value chart so we have made the place value chart for this given number now let's write place values of both of the digits of this number since seven is at one's place so place value of seven here is seven ones or seven now six is at tens place so place value of six is six tens or 60 so students we have made the place value chart as well as written the place values of both the digits now the next example is make place value chart and guide place values of 9 0 so first let's form the place value chart for this given number here 0 is at one's place so write 0 at one's place in the place value chart then we have 9 at tens place so we will write 9 at tens place in the place value chart so this is the place value chart of 9 zero now let's write place values of both the digits here we have zero at one's place students place value of 0 always remain 0 so we will write place value of 0 as 0 once or 0 then we have 9 at tens place so place value of 9 is 9 tens or 90. so we have written the place value of both the digits so now i am sure you have understood how to form place value chart and write place values of a two digit number students we would like to tell you that we have made videos on every chapter of class 1 class 2 and class 3 mathematics we also have interesting maths quizzes worksheets test papers working models activities and projects on each chapter so i would suggest you to check out our channel learning notebook now let's learn how to write expanded form and short form of a two digit number first let's understand what is expanded form of a number expanded form of a number is the sum of place values of each digit of a number students let's understand this meaning with the help of an example let's try to write the expanded form of number 24. here in number 24 4 is at one's place and 2 is at tens place so place value of 4 is 4 and place value of 2 is 20. now we have the place value of all the digits of this number so let's write its expanded form as i told you expanded form of a number is the addition of place values of all the digits in a number so expanded form of 24 will be 20 plus 4 so students 20 plus 4 is the expanded form of 24. now let's write expanded form of one more number number is 5 8 to write the expanded form first we will find the place values of both the digits since 8 is at one's place so its place value is a now 5 is at tens place so its place value is 50 now we have place value of both the digits and we know expanded form is the sum of the place values of all the digits so expanded form of this number will be [Applause] 50 [Applause] plus 8 this is the expanded form of the given number now let's learn how to read this number or we can say how to write number name for this given number to write the number name first we will look at tens place it is 50 so we will write 50 and then we will read the ones place it is a so 58 is the number name of this given number next question we have to write expanded form of this number number is 6 2 so first let's find the place values of both the digits since 2 is at one's place so its place value is 2 now 6 is at tens place so its place value is 16 so expanded form of this number is 60 plus 2 so 60 plus 2 is the expanded form of this given number now let's read this number first we will need the tens place it is 60 so let's write 60 here then we will need one's place it is 2 so number name is 62 62 is the number name of this given number now let's learn what is short form of a number when we add the expanded form of the number then we get the short form of that number for example 50 plus 6 equals to 56. 50 plus 6 is the expanded form of this number and 56 is the short form of 50 plus 6. question is find the short form of the following so here we are given the expanded forms and we have to write its short form so first expanded form is 80 plus 5 so look here students how many tens are there yes eight so write eight here next how many ones are there yes 5 so we will write 5 here this means short form of this given expanded form is 85 now let's see the next expanded form 20 plus 1 again how many tens are there 2 so write 2 next how many ones are there only one so that one so 21 is the short form of 20 plus 1 next ninety plus nine so look at tens place how many tens are there nine tens so we will write nine here then how many ones are there again 9 so 99 is the short form of this expanded form now the last expanded form is forty plus zero how many tens are there four and how many ones are there zero so 40 is the short form of 40 plus 0 now let's do an exercise question is write the place value of each digit in this number so here we are given with a 2 digit number 4 9 and we have to write place value of both of its digits so look at this one's place here we have 9 so place value of 9 will be 9 then we have 4 at tens place so its place value will be 40 so these are the place values of both the digits of this given number now next number is 9 5 so we have 5 at one's place so its place value is 5 then we have 9 a tens place so its place value is 90. so in this way we have written place value of both the digits now next number given is seven zero so here we have zero at one's place and i told you place value of zero always remain zero now we have seven at tens place so its place value will be seventy now let's see the next question make the place value chart for 2 9 and write its expanded form and number name so here first we have to make place value chart for this given number then we have to write its expanded form and then its number name so let's first make the place value chart here 9 is at one's place so let's write 9 at one's place in the place value chart then we have 2 at tens place so let's write 2 at tens place in the place value chart so we have made the place value chart for this given number now let's write its expanded form and we know expanded form is the sum of the place values of both the digits so place value of 2 is 20 and place value of 9 is 9 so we will write the expanded form as 20 plus 9. now let's write its number name for this first we will need the tens place it is 20 so let's write 20 here and then we will read the ones place we get 9 so 29 is the number name now next number given is 8 one so here also we have to first make the place value chart then write it expanded form and its number name so let's first make the place value char here we have one at one's place so let's put one at one's place in the place value chart then there is eight at tens place so let's write 8 at tens place in the place value chart now we will write its expanded form let's write the place values of both the digits place value of 8 is 80 and place value of 1 is 1 so we have got the expanded form as 80 plus 1 now we will write its number name so look at the tens place it is 80 so write 80 here and then we will look at one's place it is 1 so number name for this given number is 81 so now students i'm sure you have understood about two digit number how to make their place value chart how to write the expanded form how to find their place values and how to read their number name so in the end i am giving you a worksheet for your practice this worksheet contains questions from all the sections of the chapter which i've just taught to you so before attempting this worksheet i will suggest you to watch the video carefully you will find the answers to this worksheet below in the description box do watch my other videos and share my channel and my videos with your
